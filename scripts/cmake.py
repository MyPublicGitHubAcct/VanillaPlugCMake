"""
This script will run cmake. To run, on mac, just use 'python3 scripts/cmake.py', 
which will make both debug and release builds possible.

On Linux and Windows (which use Ninja), CMake needs to be run with awareness of which
types of builds the user would like to do.

Once cmake has run, a file will be written telling which build_type is to be used during
building and testing.

To use this file, call the command like 'python scripts/cmake.py d' or 
'python scripts/cmake.py' for debug or 'python scripts/cmake.py r' for release.
